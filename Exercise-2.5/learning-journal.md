## Exercise 2.5: Django MVT Revisited
### Learning Goals
- Add images to the model and display them on the frontend of your application
- Create complex views with access to the model
- Display records with views and templates

### Reflection Questions
1.	In your own words, explain Django static files and how Django handles them.

- Django static files are those that don't change or they require processing by Django during application runtime (CSS, JavaScript, and images). With regards to handling, Django best practices direct developers to create dedicated 'Static' directories for them.

2. Look up the following two Django packages on Django's official documentation and/or other trusted sources. Write a brief description of each.

| Package    | Description                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ListView   | A generic view in Django that displays a list of objects  |
| DetailView | A generic view in Django that displays details of objects |

3. You're now more than halfway through Achievement 2! Take a moment to reflect on your learnig in the course so far. How is it going? What's something you're proud of so far? Is there something you're struggling with? What do you need more practice with? You can use these notes to guide your next mentor call.

- I think things have been going really well. The concepts are relatively easy to grasp and work through, which I have enjoyed. I can't think of anything major that I'm struggling with. As said, the concepts are pretty straightforward and incorporating them into the project is made simpler.
