# Achievement 2

## Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django
### Learning Goals
- Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
- Summarize Django's benefits and drawbacks
- Install and get started with Django

### Reflection Questions
1. Suppose you're a web developer in a company and need to decide if you'll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

3. Now that you've had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
- What do you want to learn about Django?
- What do you want to get out of this Achievement?
- Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
