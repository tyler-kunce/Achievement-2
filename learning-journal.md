# Achievement 2

## Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django
### Learning Goals
- Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
- Summarize Django's benefits and drawbacks
- Install and get started with Django

### Reflection Questions
1. Suppose you're a web developer in a company and need to decide if you'll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

- 'Vanilla' Python offers the most flexibility as it is not constrained to the rules or restrictions of a framework (The Django Way). Unlike Django though, 'vanilla' Python doesn't have a lot of the tools and built-in/out-of-the-box functions and features that a framework offers. Lastly, one of many advantages of frameworks is that it is open-sourced with a vast community of developers while 'vanilla' requires the expertise and resourcefulness of the developer.

2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

- The biggest advantage of MVT over MVC is the simplicity in its interaction with the user, the database, the framework, and the business logic. It cuts out a lot of added steps in coding that's required of MVC.

3. Now that you've had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
- What do you want to learn about Django?
- What do you want to get out of this Achievement?
- Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

- Further my experience and expertise of Python
- Learn a Python-centric framework, Django
- Develop a more user-friendly Python-based app
