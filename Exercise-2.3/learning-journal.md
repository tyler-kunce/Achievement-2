## Exercise 2.3: Django Models
### Learning Goals
- Discuss Django models, the 'M' part of Django's MVT architecture
- Create apps and models representing different parts of your web application
- Write and run automated tests

### Reflection Questions
1.	Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.

- Django models are Python classes that define schema of the project database for a specific app. Their benefits include scalability, reusability, and efficiency/performance.

2.	In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. You can take an example project to explain your answer.

- Writing test cases from the beginning is crucial in order for the developer to ensure components and functions are working as designed/intended throughout the development cycle. Debugging and troubleshooting can take place in tandem with scaling up the project/application.
